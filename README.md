# learning-dev-flashcards
A set of flash cards that I use to keep in [Mochi](https://mochi.cards/), a spaced-repetition program.

## Why memorize?
I've long been fascinated by tools that help us *think* better, and one of the foundational aspects of thinking well is having certain facts and concepts ready-at-hand. This involves the vastly underestimated practice of *memorization*, something that for a long time—having grown up with Google and Wikipedia—I've neglected.

I grew up coding, but stopped for several years, and technology did *not* stand still for me. I remembered the broad syntax and some key concepts, but the "dictionary" had expanded: new HTML elements, CSS properties, layout options, classes, and frameworks. This learning challenge spurred me to take my interest in learning more seriously, and got me deep into the subject of spaced repetition as a tool for exponentially improving my ability to memorize.

A great introduction to the benefits of memorization and spaced repetition is Nicky Case's webcomic, ["How to Remember Anything Forever-ish"](https://ncase.me/remember/) (20-minute read). I also love the fine example of Andy Matuschak and Michael Nielsen, whose article ["How can we develop transformative tools for thought?"](https://numinous.productions/ttft/) and their experimental mnemonic essay [Quantum Country](https://quantum.country/) really helped me see the potential for this.

## What's in this deck?
I have flash cards for memorizing key vocabulary, concepts, and rules in the following areas:

* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* Accessibility
* Frameworks
* Serverless
* APIs
* NPM
* Git
* Systems
* Visual Studio
* Interviewing
* Thinking Well

Within each of these decks, I've tried to organize the cards into subdecks. So for example, the "HTML" deck contains smaller decks of "block level" and "inline" elements. CSS contains folders for "grid" and "flexbox".

## Is this useful for anyone else?
Maybe? Their content and organization reflect the idiosyncracies of my own learning path, and some of it is subjective (such as "Interviewing" and "Thinking Well"). But most of the folders contain key information that will be broadly useful.

## How can I import these?
First, download [Mochi](https://mochi.cards/) if you haven't already.

The markdown is here so that I can use Github to track my individual cards. But if you want to import these into Mochi yourself, import the `Dev.mochi` file.
